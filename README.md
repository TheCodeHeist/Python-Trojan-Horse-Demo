# Python Trojan Demo

This is a demo Trojan Horse created with Python.

`client.py` file is for the victim's interface.
`server.py` file is for the attacker's interface.

This will use server in LAN (Local Area Network). Make sure you change the `HOST` and `PORT` variables' data are changed according to your ones. (`HOST = 192.168.0.***` `PORT = 8080`)

To find your public device ip or `HOST`, go to Command Prompt or Terminal and type `ipconfig` for Windows or `ifconfig` for Linux.

**Disclaimer!**
You may copy my code to your ones, but please don't use this thing to do malicious things with others. This is only **Educational Purposes**!!!

Thank you!!
